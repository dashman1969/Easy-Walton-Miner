# Easy-Walton-Miner
Batch file setup for running the Walton miner through the command prompt. Allows the user to bypass the thread limit and reach 100% CPU usage on high power machines. Automates the startup process to be a one click solution.

How to use: 

1) Extract the file into your WTC program folder. 
2) Create a shortcut for the easy-miner.bat to wherever you want to run from (I put mine in the Desktop)
3) Click your new shortcut and copy/paste in your WTC Wallet address. 
4) You now should be mining!
