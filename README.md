How to use: 

### "Full" Version
This is the version you want if you want a lot of customization options, logging features, and other future improvements. Runs in Python which may or may not have a slight impact on performance depending on your machine.
1) Run the EasyWaltonMiner-v1.3-Setup.exe file and choose the directory you wish to install it to.
2) Click your new "EasyWaltonMiner" shortcut and copy/past in your WTC Wallet address.
3) You should now be mining!

### "Lite" Version
If you are worried about performance, or don't trust an executable file, you can download the lite version. It is entirely containted in two batch files, but it is very simplistic and will only recieve minor bug fixes going forward.
1) Run the EasyWaltonMinerLite-v1.3-Setup.exe file and choose the WTC wallet directory as the destination.
2) Click your new "EasyWaltonMinerLite" shortcut and copy/paste in your WTC Wallet address. 
3) You now should be mining!
