EasyWaltonMiner Lite v1.3.0 by LeifEricson and scavicchio


1) Copy the files to your WTC program folder.
2) Create a shortcut for the start-automated.bat
3) The miner will start automatically on opening if a pubaddr.txt is found. If not it will prompt you to enter your WTCT address. 

Note that this program cannot be run if the WTC wallet UI is open and also cannot be run simultaneously with GPU mining due to the Walton's program limitations. 

Enjoy and happy mining!
