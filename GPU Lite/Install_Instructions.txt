EasyWaltonMiner GPU Lite v1.0 by scavicchio and LeifEricson

1) Copy both batch files into your WTC program folder (or your GPU Mining program folder if you use a seperate one)
2) Create a shortcut for the start-automated-GPU.bat to your Desktop. 
3) Mining will start automatically if a pubaddr.txt is found. If not found, it will prompt you to enter your Etherbase address.

Enjoy and happy mining!
